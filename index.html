    <p>IBM was founded in 1911 as the <a href="">Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company</a> (CTR), a <a href="">holding company</a> of manufacturers of record-keeping and measuring systems. It was renamed "International Business Machines" in 1924 and soon became the leading manufacturer of <a href="">punch-card tabulating systems</a>. During the 1960s and 1970s, the <a href="">IBM mainframe</a>, exemplified by the <a href="">System/360</a> and its successors, was the world's dominant <a href="">computing platform</a>, with the company producing 80 percent of computers in the U.S. and 70 percent of computers worldwide. <a href=""><sup>[11]</sup></a>  Embracing both business and scientific computing, System/360 was the first family of computers designed to cover a complete range of applications from small to large. <a href=""><sup>[12]</sup></a>
      <br>
      <br>

IBM debuted in the <a href="">microcomputer</a> market in 1981 with the <a href="">IBM Personal Computer</a>, — its <a href="">DOS</a> software provided by <a href="">Microsoft</a>, which became the basis for the majority of <a href="">personal computers</a> to the present day. <a href=""><sup>[13]</sup></a> The company later also found success in the <a href="">portable</a> space with the <a href="">ThinkPad</a>. Since the 1990s, IBM has concentrated on <a href="">computer services</a>,<a href="">software</a> , <a href="">supercomputers</a>, and <a href="">scientific research</a>; it sold its microcomputer division to <a href="">Lenovo</a> in 2005. IBM continues to develop mainframes, and its supercomputers have <a href="">consistently ranked</a>  among the most powerful in the world in the 21st century. In 2018, IBM along with 91 additional <a href="">Fortune 500</a> companies had "paid an effective federal tax rate of 0% or less" as a result of Donald Trump's <a href="">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017</a> <a href=""><sup>[14]</sup></a>
<br><br>

As one of the world's oldest and largest technology companies, IBM has been responsible for several <a href="">technological innovations</a>, including the <a href="">Automated Teller Machine</a> (ATM),<a href="">Dynamic Random-Access Memory </a> (DRAM), the <a href="">floppy disk</a>, the <a href="">hard disk drive</a>, the <a href="">magnetic stripe card</a>, the <a href="">relational database</a>, the <a href="">SQL programming language</a>, and the <a href="">Universal Product Code</a> (UPC) barcode. The company has made inroads in advanced <a href="">computer chips</a>, <a href="">quantum computing</a>, <a href="">artificial intelligence</a>, and <a href="">data infrastructure</a>. <a href=""><sup>[15]</sup></a><a href=""><sup>[16]</sup></a><a href=""><sup>[17</sup></a>] IBM employees and alumni have won various recognitions for their scientific research and inventions, including six <a href="">Nobel Prizes</a> and six <a href="">Turing Awards</a>.[18] </p>
